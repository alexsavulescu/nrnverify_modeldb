To change mdbtest or Standard as the default comparison directories
set the variables as for example
export mdbtest=6.0.882
export standard=5.9.10

./senselabmodels.py will copy all the ModelDB NEURON model zip files
into the modeldb directory.  Alternatively one or more model object
ids can be passed on the command line to restrict the downloaded files
to these, e.g.
./senselabmodels.py object_id_1 object_id_2 object_id_3
The downloaded files are named in the format
modeldb/object_id_number.zip

sh mkmap.sh will regenerate a file map.txt that lists model object ids
paired with the name of the top level directory name from the model
zip file.

nrnziprun.dat tells how to run models for which the default single
verify_graph() is insufficient. The format is
modelname
commands
blank line

sh noruninfo.sh
tells which models do not have an explanation of how to run them
(default verify_graph_())

sh missing.sh
prints the names of models which have very small or missing gout files

sh newzipdat.sh
creates a nrnziprun.dat file with all model names and preserving the
special run methods of the previous nrnziprun.dat file.

./verify.sh takes model ids as the argument list and runs those models with
the instructions in the nrnziprun.dat file for that model or merely a
verify_graph_().
Without args it does all the modeldb zip files.

the statement "verify_graph_()" is the workhorse as it saves all lines of
all graphs to the gout file in the tmp/prefix_of_nrnzip directory. The
file executed after the mosinit.hoc file is driver.hoc. In the
tmp/prefix_of_nrnzip/extracted_nrnzip_dir one can run
nrngui mosinit.hoc ../driver.hoc
to do the same thing as the script (although stderr and stdout will come
out on the console instead of the files in tmp/prefix_of_nrnzip.

./showerr.sh lists the models that gave an error on nrnivmodl or
gave an error message when launched.

./cmpgoutfiles.sh will list all the nrnzip files where gout differs between
the Standard and the tmp

./cmpgout.sh will execute
	nrngui showgout.hoc
for all the gout's that differ.
To see just one file use
./cmpgout.sh dirname
and it will show Standard/dirname/gout and tmp/dirname/gout
The Standard lines will be black and the tmp lines will be in red.
Maximum differences between lines will be printed.
